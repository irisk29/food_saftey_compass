# Food Safety Compass — Project Context

## What this is
TAU **Text Mining 2026** capstone project (instructor: Shay Palachy Affek). Goal:
solve a real problem with a **text-analysis model built/adapted by us**, demonstrating
*deep understanding of course text-mining techniques* — NOT standard tabular ML.

**Problem:** detect food-safety / health hazards (allergic reactions, food poisoning,
etc.) in Yelp restaurant reviews. Framed as **binary text classification** (`is_hazard`),
with room to extend to hazard-type discovery (topic modeling).

## Hard constraints from the assignment
- **Focus on text analysis.** The brief explicitly says NOT to invest depth in tabular
  processing / manual feature engineering ("אין צורך להיכנס לעומק של עיבוד טבלאות").
- Must use **course text-mining techniques**: Word Embeddings, Topic Models, Document
  Embeddings, fine-tuning pretrained models (BERT/T5/spaCy), generative LMs. Transfer
  learning is encouraged, especially with little data.
- Grading rewards **depth, comparison, and understanding** — not effort or raw accuracy.
- 2-person team. Submit via GitHub (add instructor + Tal as contributors).

## Deadlines
- **Submission: 2026-08-02, midnight** — code + presentation (optional written doc).
- **Presentations: 2026-08-03** (≤15 min: problem, text-based solution, results, conclusions).

## Grade structure
- Problem definition & approach — 20%
- Text-mining design & implementation — 40%
- Results analysis & evaluation — 25%
- Presentation & summary — 15%

Rubric bands (Appendix B): one technique + TF-IDF classifier, no comparison, shallow
analysis = 55–65. Deep understanding of **≥2 techniques** + comparison + multiple
baselines + error analysis + variant experiments = 80–89. + understanding *why*
techniques work/fail, tied to the business problem = 90–100.

## Current state of the repo
- [preprocessing/final_project_preprocessing.ipynb](preprocessing/final_project_preprocessing.ipynb)
  — filters Yelp businesses to food/restaurants, streams + keyword-filters reviews,
  creates the weak `is_hazard` label (severe keyword + low stars → 1), exports
  `data/processed_allergy_hazard_dataset.csv`.
- [postprocessing/final_project_postprocessing.ipynb](postprocessing/final_project_postprocessing.ipynb)
  — engineers tabular/lexicon features (medical-lexicon density, VADER negative
  intensity, negation-window flag), saves `enriched_allergy_hazard_dataset.csv`, plus 3 EDA figures.
- Final schema: `stars, useful, funny, cool, text, word_count, char_count,
  exclamation_count, is_hazard (label), medical_lexicon_density, vader_neg_intensity,
  negation_window_flag`.

## Known risks / gaps (most important)
- **The current work is what the rubric warns against.** Label is a keyword+stars
  heuristic; features are manual/lexicon tabular features. As-is, this sits near the
  bottom band. Treat these notebooks as **preprocessing + weak-supervision label +
  baseline**, not the main deliverable.
- **Label leakage:** a classifier trained on `is_hazard` may just relearn the keyword
  rule. Need to address (e.g. hold out keyword-free validation, or hand-label a gold set).

## Step-4 modeling direction (the main deliverable)
Build a comparison of text-mining approaches, not a single classifier:
1. **TF-IDF + linear classifier** — baseline; explain what it misses.
2. **Word/Document embeddings** (Word2Vec/Doc2Vec or Sentence-BERT) — explain what each
   "sees" vs. TF-IDF.
3. **Fine-tuned transformer** (BERT/DistilBERT) — transfer learning on the hazard task.
4. (Optional) **Topic modeling (LDA/NMF)** to characterize hazard *types* (allergy vs.
   food poisoning vs. choking) — enriches beyond binary.

For each: proper metrics (not just accuracy), multiple baselines, variant experiments,
and qualitative **error analysis** tied back to the food-safety business problem.

## Working notes
- Large data files are gitignored; raw Yelp JSON is not committed.
- Subsample for fast iteration (preserve class distribution); train/evaluate on full data
  only at decision points or for final reported numbers.
